       <p align="justify">In this work, we propose a flexible family-based association test for rare variants and a binary trait using a new marginal 
          generalized functional linear mixed model with a Gaussian Copula (CBGF) while adjusting for covariates. To assess the performance of our 
          newly introduced statistics, simulation studies were conducted to evaluate type I error rates and power levels. We make a comparison with 
          some other existing statistical methods for family-based association tests.</p>

    <p align="justify"> In this work, we propose a flexible family-based  association test for rare variants in presence of binary trait using marginal 
       logistic model and a Gaussian Copula. The latter is employed to model the dependence between relatives. An analytic score-type test is derived. 
       Through simulations, we show that our method can achieve greater power than existing approaches. The proposed model is applied to investigate 
       association for Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) in a family-based cohort consisting of 17 extended families from Eastern Quebec.</p>
