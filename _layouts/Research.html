       <p align="justify">Many gene‚Äêbased association tests for dichotomous traits have been proposed recently to evaluate whether a set of variants 
          (gene/genomics region) is associated with a binary outcome, in presence of family data. However, given the discrete nature of the outcome, 
          flexible modelling of the trait-genotypes relationship together with appropriate modelling of the within-family dependence structure might 
          be lacking in the literature. Motivated by a genetic study to discover the gene regions associated with the progression of Schizophrenia (SZ) 
          and bipolar disorder (BP), we propose a flexible Copula-Based Generalized Functional association test, CBGF for short, for related subjects. 
          CBGF models the joint distribution of the binary trait, within each family, using copulas and marginal generalized functional 
          linear mixed models, and allows for adjusting for covariates/confounding. To assess the performance of our newly introduced test statistics, 
          simulation studies were conducted to evaluate type I error rates and power levels. We make a comparison with existing statistical methods 
          dealing with binary traits for family-based association tests.</p>

    <p align="justify">With the cost-effective technology in whole-genome sequencing (WGS), more sophisticated statistical methods for testing genetic 
       association with both rare and common variants are being investigated to identify the genetic variation between individuals. Several methods which 
       groupe variants, also called gene-based or variant-set approaches, are developed. For instance, advanced extensions of the sequence kernel 
       association test, which is a widely used variant-set test, have been proposed for unrelated samples and extended for family data. 
       Family data have been shown to be powerful when analyzing rare variants. However, most of such methods capture familial relatedness 
       using a random effect component within the GLMM framework. Therefore, there is a need to develop unified and flexible methods to study 
       association between a set of (possibly rare) genetic variants and a trait, especially for a binary (or discrete) outcome. Copulas are 
       multivariate  distribution functions  with  uniform margins on the $[0, 1]$ interval and they  provide  suitable models to capture 
       familial dependence structure. In this work, we propose a flexible family-based association test for both rare and common variants 
       in presence of binary trait. The method, termed novel rare variant association test, NRVAT for short, uses marginal logistic model 
       and a Gaussian Copula. The latter is employed to model the dependence between relatives. An analytic score-type test is derived. 
       Through simulations, we show that our method can achieve greater power than existing approaches.</p>
